authorize-net-python
====================

Very crude example of how to implement the Authorize.net Direct Post Method (DPM).

You will need an authorize.net sandbox account. See the demo.py code for where to put your values.

Will also most likely need to adjust firewalls and router configs to allow authorize.net to post back to you.

To get started
  
    $ virtualenv authorize-net-python-env
    $ source authorize-net-python-env/bin/activate
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ python demo.py
